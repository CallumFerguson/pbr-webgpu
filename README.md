# PBR in WebGPU

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

This is example of a PBR (_Physically Based Rendering_) with IBL (_Image Based Lighting_) written in WebGPU. At the moment of writing this I couldn't find any learning materials explaining how to do this so I made it with a lot of trial and error, exploring how to map WebGL concept and APIs to WebGPU.

I hope it will be useful to you!

## How to run

1. Install dependencies (works interchangeably with `pnpm` and `yarn` if you prefer).

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run development server.

   ```
   npm run vite dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
